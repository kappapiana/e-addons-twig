A faster, easier and more powerful way to build Elementor Templates with Twig

== Description ==

Twig with Timber is for both WordPress pros and rookies. 
People new to WordPress will like how it reduces the WordPress-specific knowledge required to create Elementor Templates used in a website. 
While pros can take advantage of object-oriented patterns that adhere to DRY and MVC principles.
